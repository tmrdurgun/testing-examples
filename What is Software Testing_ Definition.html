                        <p><strong>Software Testing</strong> is a method to check whether the
                          actual software product matches expected requirements and to ensure
                          that software product is Defect free. It involves execution
                          of software/system components using manual or automated tools to
                          evaluate one or more properties of interest. The purpose of software
                          testing is to identify errors, gaps or missing requirements in
                          contrast to actual requirements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Software Testing is Important</strong> because if there are
                          any bugs or errors in the software, it can be identified early and
                          can be solved before delivery of the software product. Properly
                          tested software product ensures reliability, security and high
                          performance which further results in time saving, cost effectiveness
                          and customer satisfaction.</p>

                      <strong>What is the need of Testing?</strong>
                      <p>Testing is important because software bugs could be expensive or even
                        dangerous. Software bugs can potentially cause monetary and human loss,
                        and history is full of such examples.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>In April 2015, Bloomberg terminal in London crashed due to software
                          glitch affected more than 300,000 traders on financial markets. It
                          forced the government to postpone a 3bn pound debt sale.</li>
                        <li>Nissan cars recalled over 1 million cars from the market due to
                          software failure in the airbag sensory detectors. There has been
                          reported two accident due to this software failure.</li>
                        <li>Starbucks was forced to close about 60 percent of stores in the U.S
                          and Canada due to software failure in its POS system. At one point,
                          the store served coffee for free as they were unable to process the
                          transaction.</li>
                        <li>Some of Amazon’s third-party retailers saw their product price is
                          reduced to 1p due to a software glitch. They were left with heavy
                          losses.</li>
                        <li>Vulnerability in Windows 10. This bug enables users to escape from
                          security sandboxes through a flaw in the win32k system.</li>
                        <li>In 2015 fighter plane F-35 fell victim to a software bug, making it
                          unable to detect targets correctly.</li>
                        <li>China Airlines Airbus A300 crashed due to a software bug on April
                          26, 1994, killing 264 innocents live</li>
                        <li>In 1985, Canada’s Therac-25 radiation therapy machine malfunctioned
                          due to software bug and delivered lethal radiation doses to
                          patients, leaving 3 people dead and critically injuring 3 others.
                        </li>
                        <li>In April of 1999, a software bug caused the failure of a $1.2
                          billion military satellite launch, the costliest accident in history
                        </li>
                        <li>In May of 1996, a software bug caused the bank accounts of 823
                          customers of a major U.S. bank to be credited with 920 million US
                          dollars.</li>

                        <p>Here are the benefits of using software testing:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Cost-Effective: </strong>It is one of the important
                            advantages of software testing. Testing any IT project on time
                            helps you to save your money for the long term. In case if the
                            bugs caught in the earlier stage of software testing, it costs
                            less to fix.</li>
                          <li><strong>Security: </strong>It is the most vulnerable and
                            sensitive benefit of software testing. People are looking for
                            trusted products. It helps in removing risks and problems
                            earlier.</li>
                          <li><strong>Product quality: </strong>It is an essential requirement
                            of any software product. Testing ensures a quality product is
                            delivered to customers.</li>
                          <li><strong>Customer Satisfaction: </strong>The main aim of any
                            product is to give satisfaction to their customers. UI/UX
                            Testing ensures the best user experience.</li>

                        <p>As per ANSI/IEEE 1059, <strong>Testing in Software
                            Engineering</strong> is a process of evaluating a software
                          product to find whether the current software product meets the
                          required conditions or not. The testing process involves evaluating
                          the features of the software product for requirements in terms of
                          any missing requirements, bugs or errors, security, reliability and

                                    <p>Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components
                                      of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the
                                      software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development
                                      (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section
                                      of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method,
                                      procedure, module, or object.</p>
                                  </li>

                                      Integration Testing is defined as a type of testing where software modules are
                                      integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of
                                      multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this
                                      level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction between these software
                                      modules when they are integrated

                        <p>Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are
                          developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each
                          functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written
                          in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.</p>

                        <p>
                          Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small
                          functionality of an application. TDD framework instructs developers to write new code only if
                          an automated test has failed. This avoids duplication of code. The TDD full form is
                          Test-driven development.

                      <p>Here are important strategies in software engineering:</p>
                      <p><strong>Unit Testing: </strong> This software testing basic approach is
                        followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps
                        developers to know whether the individual unit of the code is working
                        properly or not.</p>
                      <p><strong>Integration testing: </strong>It focuses on the construction and
                        design of the software. You need to see that the integrated units are
                        working without errors or not.</p>
                      <p><strong>System testing: </strong>In this method, your software is
                        compiled as a whole and then tested as a whole. This testing strategy
                        checks the functionality, security, portability, amongst others.</p>

                            Testing</span></h2>
                        <p><strong>Program Testing</strong> in software testing is a method of
                          executing an actual software program with the aim of testing program
                          behavior and finding errors. The software program is executed with
                          test case data to analyse the program behavior or response to the
                          test data. A good program testing is one which has high chances of
                          finding bugs.</p>

                        <h2>What is Jest?</h2>
                        <p>Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript
                          codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API
                          that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can
                          be extended to match your requirements.</p>

                        <p>
                          Jest utilizes nodejs vm functionality, that allows to control and modify code execution.
